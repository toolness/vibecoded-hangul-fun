In friend-and-trip-words.txt, you will find a list of Korean words in various
forms (e.g., words with particles at the end, conjugated verbs, etc).

In vocabulary.md, you will also find a list of (bolded) Korean words in various
forms (usually the verbs will be in their dictionary form, but sometimes
they'll be in an adjectival or nominalized form, etc).

I want you to create a JSON object that maps words from friend-and-trip-words.txt
to words in vocabulary.md.

The values should be arrays of strings, since a single word can map to multiple
vocab words (e.g., compound words like "노래방" could map to ["노래", "방"]).

If there are any words in the first file that don't appear in any form in the
second, simply omit them from the mapping (don't include null entries).

Here's an example of something you might output:

{
  "친구를": ["친구"],
  "갔다": ["가다"],
  "노래방에": ["노래", "방"]
}

You only need to look at friend-and-trip-words.txt and vocabulary.md. Don't look
at any other files.

Write the output json to friend-and-trip-mapping.json.
