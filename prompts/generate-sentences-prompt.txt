In `vocabulary.md`, you will find a list of (bolded) Korean words in
various forms. Usually the verbs will be in their dictionary form, but
sometimes they'll be in an adjectival or nominalized form, etc.

I want you to use this vocabulary list to construct 10 simple sentences.
Each sentence should be a `AiGeneratedFillInTheBlankSentence`, as
defined in `src/dynamic-cards/aiGeneratedFillInTheBlank.ts`, and your
output should be a JSON array of `AiGeneratedFillInTheBlankSentence`
objects.

Each sentence can use the kinds of grammatical features outlined in
the example sentences at the end of `vocabulary.md`.

Output the final JSON to `src/assets/ai-generated-sentences.json`.
If the file already exists, add the new sentences to its array.
