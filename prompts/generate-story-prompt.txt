In `vocabulary.md`, you will find a list of (bolded) Korean words in
various forms. Usually the verbs will be in their dictionary form, but
sometimes they'll be in an adjectival or nominalized form, etc.

Make a simple story using these words. You'll find some example sentences
at the end of `vocabulary.md` and can use these as a guide to the
kinds of grammar you should use (these stories will be read by people
learning Korean, so don't get too advanced).

You can manipulate any of the words in the vocabulary list grammatically,
which means that you can conjugate them, nominalize them, and so on.

Here's some examples:

* if the word "좋습니다" is in the vocabulary list, you can use any
  form of "좋다".
* if the word "아름다운" is in the vocabulary list, you can use any
  form of "아름답다".
* if "조금" is in the vocabulary list, you can use its abbreviated
  form, "좀".
* if "웃다" and "주다" are in the vocabulary list, you can combine
  them to form a compound verb like "웃어주었습니다".

As you construct each sentence, put the word(s) from the vocabulary
list in parentheses after they're mentioned in the sentence. For
example, assuming that "연못", "웃다", and "주다" are in the vocabulary
list, you might generate the following sentence:

연못도 (연못) 그에게 웃어주었습니다 (웃다, 주다).

Please keep to this format as much as possible, and use the exact
word as it appears in the vocabulary list: your output will
later be parsed to map the words in a sentence back to their entries
in the vocabulary list.

Give the story a short slug-like title and write it to the
`stories` subdirectory (creating it if it doesn't already exist),
giving it a `.txt` file ending. An example might be
`stories/friend-and-trip.txt`.
