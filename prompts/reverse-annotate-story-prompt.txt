In `vocabulary.md`, you will find a list of (bolded) Korean words in
various forms. Usually the verbs will be in their dictionary form, but
sometimes they'll be in an adjectival or nominalized form, etc.

See `stories/my-cool-story.plain.txt` for a story. It uses
words from the vocabulary list in various forms--conjugated, nominalized,
abbreviated, and so on.

Here's some examples:

* if the word "좋습니다" is in the vocabulary list, the story may use any
  form of "좋다".
* if the word "아름다운" is in the vocabulary list, the story may use any
  form of "아름답다".
* if "조금" is in the vocabulary list, the story may use its abbreviated
  form, "좀".
* if "웃다" and "주다" are in the vocabulary list, the story may combine
  them to form a compound verb like "웃어주었습니다".

Transcribe the same story to `stories/my-cool-story.txt`
(that is, the file name without the `.plain` in it), but annotate it
with the original word(s) from the vocabulary list in parentheses immediately
after they're mentioned in the story. For example, assume the story has
the following sentence:

연못도 그에게 웃어주었습니다.

Now, assuming that "연못", "웃다", and "주다" are in the vocabulary
list, you would rewrite it as:

연못도 (연못) 그에게 웃어주었습니다 (웃다, 주다).

Please keep to this format as much as possible; don't modify any of
the words in the original story, and use the exact word as it appears
in the vocabulary list: your output will later be parsed to map the
original story's words back to their entries in the vocabulary list.
